  <h1>Maintainership</h1>

  <p>GNU Radio is currently maintained by:<br>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.comsec.com">Eric Blossom</a>
  </ul>
      
  <h1>Coding Standards</h1>

  <p>All contributions should conform to the <a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html">GNU Coding
  Standards</a>.  Note that some
	  portions of the existing code base do not conform.  Use your
	  best judgement.  New code must conform.
	  
  <h1>Copyright Assignment</h1>

  <p>Before we can accept non-trivial code contributions from you, we
  need a copyright assignment on file with the FSF.  A description of
  the process is available <a href=" http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain_6.html"
  >here</a>.  This boils down to the following instructions:

  <ul>
    <li>If you've developed some addition or patch to GNU Radio that you
    would like to contribute, you should send mail to the <a
    href="mailto:patch-gnuradio@gnu.org">patch-gnuradio@gnu.org</a> list, or
    to one of the GNU Radio maintainers asking for an appropriate form.  We
    might ask you for some more information at this point.

    <li>You will be sent a short form by email which you should fill in and
    email back to the FSF.

    <li>Once the FSF have received this email, they will send you a paper
    copy of the full copyright assignment papers for you to sign and post
    back to them.

    <li>As soon as the signed paperwork is filed at the FSF we can accept
    your changes into the soure tree.

    <li>Individual small changes (fewer than 10 lines of code) can, however,
    be accepted without a copyright assignment form on file.
  </ul>

  <h1>Submitting Patches</h1>

  <p>Every patch must have several pieces of information before we can
  properly evaluate it.

  <ul>
    <li>A description of the bug and how your patch fixes this bug.  For
    new features a description of the feature and your implementation.
    Patches which include new test cases are especially welcome.
    <li>A ChangeLog entry as plaintext; see the various ChangeLog files
    for format and content.<br>
    <li>The patch itself.  If you are accessing the
    CVS repository at gnu.org, use &quot;<tt>cvs update; cvs diff -u</tt>
    &quot;; else, use &quot;<tt>diff -u OLD NEW</tt>&quot;.  If your version
    of diff does not support these options, then get the latest version of
    GNU diff.
    <li>If your changes add a new feature, please provide documentation as
    a patch to the texinfo docs.
  </ul>

  <p>If you develop your changes in a cvs checkout tree, The
  <tt>cvsdiff</tt> utility from the unreleased <a
  href="http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/cvs-utils/">cvs-utils</a>
  project will create a suitable file for you to send to us.

  <p>Submit your patch by sending it to the <a
  href="mailto:patch-gnuradio@gnu.org">patch-gnuradio@gnu.org</a>
  mailing list.

  <p>When you have submitted your patch, somebody will
  tell you what to do next.  If the patch is small, just send it directly
  to the list.  Be sure to send the patch as a mime text attachment, or
  pasted directly into the mail.  Uuencoded patches, or patches
  otherwise rendered unreadable by peculiar mime encoding make it much
  harder for the gnuradio developers to read and/or apply your patch.  If your
  patch is very large (more than a hundred kilobytes), try to upload
  the patch itself to savannah and post only a link to the mailing list.

  <p>Persistent contributors who submit high quality patches may be
  given direct cvs access.

  <h1>Submitting Bug Reports</h1>


  <p>There is a special list for reporting bugs, <a
  href="mailto:bug-gnuradio@gnu.org"><b>bug-gnuradio@gnu.org</b></a>,
  to enable the developers to track submitted bug reports.  If you
  think you have found a bug in gnuradio, please send as complete a
  report as possible to this list.  Ideally, you should include the
  text you get by running <samp>config.guess</samp>, the text you see
  when you run <samp>configure</samp>, and if you can, a patch made
  with <samp>diff -u5</samp> which fixes the problem.  If you can send
  a small script which fails with the unpatched distribution, but
  passes with your patch applied we can add the test to the
  distribution to make sure the bug doesn't reappear.
